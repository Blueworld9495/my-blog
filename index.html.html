     <h4><b>I HAVE A WRISTWATCH,BUT HAVE NO TIME</b></h4>
  <p class="paragraph">We always feel comfortable in believing we have time in our possession to cover up for our laxity and procrastination. Our great desire for success and accomplishments most times get delayed or denied due to our settlement in our zone believe of time possession.Such belief makes us find procrastination as a best working tool for life continuity. We may not get the sudden devastating effect of such tool, it happens slowly. For some, it is a quick effect on their existence.The beauty of time is the ability to serve and also lead in a person’s mental government structure and the feeling of relaxation and self satisfaction it brings when used (even if it’s properly or not properly used, you can’t deny the feeling). The possession of wristwatch brings to our consciousness the beauty of time; the beautiful options for discipline, urge for consistency, state of alertness, time management and exposure to reality. We can’t be ready for life if we still have the nature of time mismanagement</p>
  <p>We can’t be ready for life if we still have the nature of time mismanagement. We all have plans, dreams and ambitions (even a lazy person has such desires) but many end up not reaching the zenith of their potentials. Time allows us to dream and wish but good time management brings dreams and wishes into reality. Every day of our life, time draws us closer to reality check, I am not pressuring you, but all things being equal, HOW WELL HAVE YOU MANAGED YOUR TIME? I will allow u be honest with your response, it will be self-destruction if you feel comfortable in feeding your efforts with lies. It is normal to have an unsettled beginning, many don’t discover purpose in time but it won’t be fair if you build your ambitions on such structure. Have you ever wondered why athletes run in a competition for a prize and it happens only one person will be crowned the winner? Do you want to call it luck, or are you saying with luck, efforts and hard work don’t matter? Is the winner more hardworking than others, or did others become lazy in preparing for the race and ended up not becoming winners? Let me bring to your understanding the exposure of time; the season of time, the reason of time and the fruits of time</p>

    <h4><b>TIME AND A WRISTWATCH</b></h4>
  <P class="paragraph">If an athlete decides to play when he is to train, he might end up playing away his proper use of time. It is important we have a structural understanding about our vision and the role, work and rest is to play in respect to time use. We learn every day, an athlete needs to learn the language of dedication, consistency and discipline. But if he’s used to the learning process oflaxity and procrastination acceptance, then he needs to unlearn. Yes. I know you are fast in telling me most times an athlete not winning may not be as a result of failed adherence to time principle. Let me bring your mind to reality, it is never easy, to become a winner is not easy, to fail is not easy. But what is easy is living in your comfort zone. Have you observed my continuous use of the word consistency, life is not built on a reward system but life will never reward minds that fail in being consistent. WE ARE ALL ATHLETES IN OUR LIFE RACE. Discipline is the foundation you need to build your time on. It takes discipline to understand the principle of time. Discipline exposes you to the reality use of a wrist watch that plants in you the consciousness of time and the call for proper time management. Most times, an individual background can slow the process to entering the terrain of discipline effect. Many come from an upbringing where anything goes, life works without a direction, an upbringing that grants numerous wishes of unproductive activities. Remember when I said, there’s a season of time to learn and a season of time to unlearn just to learn more. The first step to transit from such background to a reality check of proper time use through discipline impact, is to learn and unlearn. The greatest problem of the mind is the ability to come to the truth of growth</P>
  <p> You can’t be disciplined and fail to bear the fruits of consistency and dedication. It takes a man with vision to be dedicated and stay consistent. Everyday might not be for victory, but staying consistent with dedication every day will draw you closer to days of victory. It is never easy, I repeat it is never easy, but it is even more hard when you fail to discover a purpose, it’s harder when you live your life out of the environment of time principle. If you acquire a wristwatch, it allows you control your movements and activities to some extent, it controls your conscious state. But time is limited. It’s limitless but it comes with an end for all, even when we control our movements and activities time limits us to the consequences of our actions. It brings to our table the reality of life. NO MATTER WHO OWNS THE WRIST WATCH, WE DONT OWN TIME BUT WE CAN DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH TIME.I hope you find comfort in this, I pray this gives you hope, I hope your dreams and visions gets the best time for its reality accomplishments. Remember, we might not get what we want now but with time what we want will sure be what we get. The principle of time states; THERE IS TIME FOR EVERYTHING.</p>
